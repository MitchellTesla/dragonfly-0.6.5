Dragonfly -- a speech recognition extension library
============================================================================

Dragonfly offers a powerful Python interface to speech 
recognition and a high-level language object model to easily 
create and use voice commands.  Dragonfly supports following 
speech recognition engines:

 - Dragon NaturallySpeaking (DNS), a product of *Nuance*
 - Windows Speech Recognition (WSR), included with Microsoft 
   Windows Vista and freely available for Windows XP


Basic example
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A very simple example of Dragonfly usage is to create a static 
voice command with a callback that will be called when the 
command is spoken.  This is done as follows: ::

   from dragonfly.all import Grammar, CompoundRule

   # Voice command rule combining spoken form and recognition processing.
   class ExampleRule(CompoundRule):
       spec = "do something computer"                  # Spoken form of command.
       def _process_recognition(self, node, extras):   # Callback when command is spoken.
           print "Voice command spoken."

   # Create a grammar which contains and loads the command rule.
   grammar = Grammar("example grammar")                # Create a grammar to contain the command rule.
   grammar.add_rule(ExampleRule())                     # Add the command rule to the grammar.
   grammar.load()                                      # Load the grammar.

The example above is very basic and doesn't show any of 
Dragonfly's exciting features, such as dynamic speech elements. 
To learn more about these, please take a look at the project's 
documentation `here <http://dragonfly.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dragonfly/documentation/index.html>`_.
