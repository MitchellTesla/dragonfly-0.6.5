Description: 
        Dragonfly -- a speech recognition extension library
        ============================================================================
        
        Dragonfly offers a powerful Python interface to speech
        recognition and a high-level language object model to easily
        create and use voice commands.  Dragonfly supports following
        speech recognition engines:
        
        - Dragon NaturallySpeaking (DNS), a product of *Nuance*
        - Windows Speech Recognition (WSR), included with Microsoft
        Windows Vista and freely available for Windows XP
        
        
        Basic example
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        A very simple example of Dragonfly usage is to create a static
        voice command with a callback that will be called when the
        command is spoken.  This is done as follows: ::
        
        from dragonfly.all import Grammar, CompoundRule
        
        # Voice command rule combining spoken form and recognition processing.
        class ExampleRule(CompoundRule):
        spec = "do something computer"                  # Spoken form of command.
        def _process_recognition(self, node, extras):   # Callback when command is spoken.
        print "Voice command spoken."
        
        # Create a grammar which contains and loads the command rule.
        grammar = Grammar("example grammar")                # Create a grammar to contain the command rule.
        grammar.add_rule(ExampleRule())                     # Add the command rule to the grammar.
        grammar.load()                                      # Load the grammar.
        
        The example above is very basic and doesn't show any of
        Dragonfly's exciting features, such as dynamic speech elements.
        To learn more about these, please take a look at the project's
